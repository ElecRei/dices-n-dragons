# Dices'n'Dragons
Simple dice roller for DnD for the frugal player.

## What's this about?
I decided to make a simple dice roller for DnD since I'm trying to learn it and really don't feel like buying dice. The main part of the project is to generate random numbers within a set range but I also want to add some UI elements to make it more engaging than a bunch of buttons you'll just click. For example inluding an image of said dice.

Anyhow I will be working on this project alongside my Fishing Guide for Wild World so be sure to check this out too for updates.
